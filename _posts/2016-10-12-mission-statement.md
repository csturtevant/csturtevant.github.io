## I aim to be a student for the rest of my life.

I want to learn to create meaningful contributions to help others, while having fun along the way. In this process I will communicate my learnings here, with the hope that my notes will be useful to some.

In each post I will share my best understanding of the subject, and with eager avoidance of the Dunning-Kruger effect, I encourage suggestions and advice. I will always correct any misinformation as this will further my own education just as well as anyone who would view these pages.
