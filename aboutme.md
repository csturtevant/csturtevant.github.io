Welcome!

My name is Chris Sturtevant.

I am a passionate fan of software programming's ability to help real people as well as automating the unnecessary. 

I also enjoy: 
- Software Tools
- Reading
- Fitness
- Health
- Having my perspective changed

I adore learning, being introduced to new experiences, new people, and feel free to discuss anything with me!
