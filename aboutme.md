I am a passionate fan of software programming's ability to help real people as well as automating the unnecessary. 

I also enjoy: 
* Software Tools
* Reading
* Fitness
* Health
* Having my perspective changed

I adore learning, being introduced to new experiences and new people. 

Feel free to discuss anything with me!
